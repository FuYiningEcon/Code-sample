We estimate the return to migration while accounting for migrant selection by comparing Norway-to-US migrants with their brothers who stayed in Norway in the late nineteenth century. We also compare fathers of migrants and nonmigrants by wealth and occupation. We find that the return to migration was relatively low (70 percent) and that migrants from urban areas were negatively selected from the sending population. (JEL J11, J61, N31, N33)},

Cross-sectional patterns are driven by biases from declining arrival cohort skill level and departures of negatively selected return migrants.

  abstract = {An inventor's own knowledge is a key input in the innovation process. This knowledge can be built by interacting with and learning from others. This paper uses a new large-scale panel dataset on European inventors matched to their employers and patents. We document key empirical facts on inventors' productivity over the life cycle, inventors' research teams, and interactions with other inventors. Among others, most patents are the result of collaborative work. Interactions with better inventors are very strongly correlated with higher subsequent productivity. These facts motivate the main ingredients of our new innovation-led endogenous growth model, in which innovations are produced by heterogeneous research teams of inventors using inventor knowledge. The evolution of an inventor's knowledge is explained through the lens of a diffusion model in which inventors can learn in two ways: By interacting with others at an endogenously chosen rate; and from an external, age-dependent source that captures alternative learning channels, such as learning-by-doing. Thus, our knowledge diffusion model nests inside the innovation-based endogenous growth model. We estimate the model, which fits the data very closely, and use it to perform several policy exercises, such as quantifying the large importance of interactions for growth, studying the effects of reducing interaction costs (e.g., through IT or infrastructure), and comparing the learning and innovation processes of different countries.},

  abstract = {Rural to urban migration is an integral part of the development process, but there is little evidence on how out-migration transforms rural labor markets. Emigration could benefit landless village residents by reducing labor competition, or conversely, reduce productivity if skilled workers leave. We offer to subsidize transport costs for 5792 potential seasonal migrants in Bangladesh, randomly varying saturation of offers across 133 villages. The transport subsidies increase beneficiaries' income due to better employment opportunities in the city, and also generate the following spillovers: (a) A higher density of offers increases the individual take-up rate, and induces those connected to offered recipients to also migrate. The village emigration rate increases from 35\% to 65\%. (b) This increases the male agricultural wage rate in the village by 4.5-6.6\%, and the available work hours in the village by 11-14\%, which combine to increase income earned in the village, (c) There is no intra-household substitution in labor supply, but primary workers within households earn more during weeks in which many of their village co-residents moved away. (d) The wage bill for agricultural employers increases, which reduces their profit, with no significant change in yield. (e) Food prices increase by 2.7\% on net, driven by an increase in the price of (fish) protein, and offset by (f) a decrease in the price of non-tradables like prepared food and tea. Seasonal migration subsidies not only generate large direct benefits, but also indirect spillover benefits by creating slack in the village-of-origin labor market during the lean season.},

  abstract = {China strongly restricts rural--urban migration, resulting in a well acknowledged surplus of labor in agriculture. But migration is also restricted within sectors. This paper argues that these intra-sector restrictions lead to insufficient agglomeration of economic activity in both the rural industrial and urban sectors, with resulting first order losses in GDP. For urban areas the paper estimates a city productivity relationship, based on city GDP numbers. The effects of access, educational attainment, FDI, and public infrastructure on productivity are estimated. Given these, worker productivity is shown to be an inverted U-shape function of city employment, with the peak point shifting out as industrial composition moves from manufacturing to services, as predicted by urban theory. As far as we know this is the first paper to actually estimate the relationship between output per worker and city scale for any country. The majority of Chinese cities are shown to be potentially undersized---below the lower bound on the 95\% confidence interval about the size where their output per worker peaks. The paper calculates the large gains from increased agglomeration in both the rural industrial and urban sectors.},

Our results, tested on a panel of 20 OECD countries (1987--2016), show that i) high-skilled migration magnifies the effect of internal knowledge in improving national innovation performances (while middle- or low-skilled migration flows have no statistically significant effect); ii) knowledge spillovers are stronger if origin and destination countries assign similar share of their public R\&D budget across the same technological fields; iii) the contribution of high-skilled migrants is most valuable when host countries are relatively lagging behind in active research and innovation policies.},

To do so, we link patent records to a database containing the first five digits of more than 230 million of Social Security Numbers (SSN). By combining this part of the SSN together with year of birth, we identify whether individuals are immigrants based on the age at which their Social Security Number is assigned. We find immigrants represent 16 percent of all US inventors, but produced 23 percent of total innovation output, as measured by number of patents, patent citations, and the economic value of these patents. Immigrant inventors are more likely to rely on foreign technologies, to collaborate with foreign inventors, and to be cited in foreign markets, thus contributing to the importation and diffusion of ideas across borders. Using an identification strategy that exploits premature inventor deaths, we find that immigrant inventors create especially strong positive externalities on the innovation production of their collaborators, while natives have a much weaker impact. A simple decomposition illustrates that immigrants are responsible for 36\% of aggregate innovation, two-thirds of which is due to their innovation externalities on their native-born collaborators.},

While many studies have investigated the influence of robotization on labor market in the automation-advanced countries, few works shed light on the situation in the emerging market. We provide empirical evidence on the effect of industrial robots on intercity migration in China. We find that, industrial robot adoption has a significant negative effect on the net inflow migration by reducing population inflows, while has little effect on population outflows. The decline in population inflows is concentrated among low-skilled migrants who are younger, less educated and in manufacturing sectors, because they are more likely to experience unemployment and wage declines in the face of industrial robots. The analysis of migration cost demonstrates that the negative impact of industrial robots on population inflows increases with the longer migration distances, higher living costs, and greater institutional entry barriers caused by Hukou Registration System in China. {\copyright} 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

This paper develops a new approach for estimating the labor market impact of immigration by exploiting this variation in supply shifts across education-experience groups. I assume that similarly educated workers with different levels of experience participate in a national labor market and are not perfect substitutes. The analysis indicates that immigration lowers the wage of competing workers: a 10 percent increase in supply reduces wages by 3 to 4 percent.},

We provide a new econometric framework for shift-share instrumental variable (SSIV) regressions in which identification follows from the quasi-random assignment of shocks, while exposure shares are allowed to be endogenous. The framework is motivated by an equivalence result: the orthogonality between a shift-share instrument and an unobserved residual can be represented as the orthogonality between the underlying shocks and a shock-level unobservable. SSIV regression coefficients can similarly be obtained from an equivalent shock-level regression, motivating shock-level conditions for their consistency. We discuss and illustrate several practical insights of this framework in the setting of Autor et al. (2013), estimating the effect of Chinese import competition on manufacturing employment across U.S. commuting zones.},

We show immigration has a positive causal impact on innovation, measured as patenting of local firms, and on economic growth, measured as real income growth for native workers. We interpret those results through the lens of a quantitative model of endogenous growth and migrations. A structural estimation of this model targeting the well identified causal impact of migration on innovation suggests the large inflow of foreign migrants into the US since 1965 may have contributed to an additional 8\% growth in innovation and 5\% growth in wages.},

To isolate the causal effect of ancestry on FDI, we build a simple reduced-form model of migrations: Migrations from a foreign country to a U.S. county at a given time depend on (1) a push factor, causing emigration from that foreign country to the entire U.S., and (2) a pull factor, causing immigration from all origins into that U.S. county. The interaction between time-series variation in origin-specific push factors and destination-specific pull factors generates quasi-random variation in the allocation of migrants across U.S. counties. We find that doubling the number of residents with ancestry from a given foreign country relative to the mean increases the probability that at least one local firm engages in FDI with that country by 4 percentage points. We present evidence that this effect is primarily driven by a reduction in information frictions, and not by better contract enforcement, taste similarities, or a convergence in factor endowments.},

While capital markets are crucial for innovation, the extent to which publicly listed firms facilitate knowledge flow remains unclear. This research delineates the circulation of technological knowledge both intra- and intercompany, across similar and disparate industries, and between listed companies and non-listed innovative entities. The findings indicate a pronounced tendency among technology-intensive listed companies to cite their patents extensively. Self-citations comprise nearly 60 \% of total citations, suggesting that technological knowledge primarily circulates within individual companies. Furthermore, the exchange of technological knowledge among different listed companies within the same industry is notably sparse, with only a fractional increase in the frequency of knowledge flows within the industry compared to across industry boundaries. Predominantly, the technological knowledge that technology-intensive listed companies acquire from non-listed innovative entities stems from domestic unlisted companies, with foreign entities and universities contributing to a lesser extent. When examining the spillover of technological knowledge to non-listed innovative entities, it is observed that other non-listed companies predominantly absorb such knowledge, with universities and individual innovators receiving lesser proportions. Finally, this study is significant as it provides empirical evidence on the flow of technological knowledge within and between publicly listed technology-intensive companies in China, revealing the dominance of self-citations and limited cross-company knowledge exchange. By analyzing patent citation data, this research provides valuable insights into the interactions between listed companies and nonlisted innovative entities. The findings highlight the significant role of non-listed firms, universities, and foreign entities in shaping technological development. Strengthening these connections can further foster innovation and en hance knowledge diffusion across sectors.},

We build a new index to measure the likelihood of obtaining urban hukou for migrants in each destination city, termed the ``settlement probability'', based on individual information of floating population from the population census and hukou policies of 332 cities from 1996 to 2022. We find that the average settlement probability has been steadily increasing since 1999, reaching 91\% in 2022, and 15 provinces have achieved low thresholds. We further build a simple general spatial equilibrium model with the factor of settlement probability to investigate the impacts of hukou reform. The empirical analysis shows there is a mismatch between settlement probability and settlement intentions. Moreover, we find that higher settlement probability is significantly correlated with more migrants' inflow, lower migrants' wages and higher urban housing prices, especially in more developed cities. Therefore, hukou reform is crucial for enhancing the integration of China's labor market.},

Return migration is an important driver of this {\textbackslash}\&quot;return innovation{\textbackslash}\&quot; effect.

We then use a stylized growth model to analyze the various channels through which a brain drain affects the sending countries and review the evidence on these channels. The recent empirical literature shows that high-skill emigration need not deplete a country's human capital stock and can generate positive network externalities. Three case studies are also considered: the African medical brain drain, the exodus of European scientists to the United States, and the role of the Indian diaspora in the development of India's information technology sector. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the analysis for education, immigration, and international taxation policies in a global context. ( JEL F02, F22, J24, J61, O15)},

  abstract = {AbstractBy exploiting a commuting policy that led to a sharp and unexpected inflow of Czech workers to areas along the German-Czech border, we examine the impact of an exogenous immigration-induced labor supply shock on local wages and employment of natives. On average, the supply shock leads to a moderate decline in local native wages and a sharp decline in local native employment. These average effects mask considerable heterogeneity across groups: while younger natives experience larger wage effects, employment responses are particularly pronounced for older natives. This pattern is inconsistent with standard models of immigration but can be accounted for by a model that allows for a larger labor supply elasticity or a higher degree of wage rigidity for older than for young workers. We further show that the employment response is almost entirely driven by diminished inflows of natives into work rather than outflows into other areas or nonemployment, suggesting that ``outsiders'' shield ``insiders'' from the increased competition.},

We find that increases in worker eligibility for urban residence registration (Hukou) across origin-destination pairs increase rural-urban exports, imports, capital inflows and outflows, both in terms of bilateral transaction values and the number of unique buyer-seller matches. To quantify the implications at the regional level, we interpret these estimates through the lens of a spatial equilibrium model in which migrants can reduce buyer-seller matching frictions. We find that a 10\% increase in a rural county's migration market access on average leads to a 1.5\% increase in the county's trade market access and a 2\% increase in investment market access. In the context of China's recent Hukou reforms, we find that these knock-on effects on market integration were on average larger among the urban destinations compared to the rural origins, reinforcing incentives for rural-urban migration.},

Combining microdata and a spatial equilibrium model, we quantify the impact of the massive spatial reallocation of workers and the rapid growth of housing costs on the national income distribution. We first show several stylized facts detailing the strong positive correlation between migration flows, housing costs, and imputed income inequality among Chinese cities. We then build a spatial equilibrium model featuring workers with heterogeneous skills, housing constraints, and heterogeneous returns from housing ownership to explain these facts. Our quantitative results indicate that reductions in migration costs and the divergent growth in productivity across cities and skills result in the observed massive migration to developed areas. Combined with tight land supply policies in big cities, the expansion of housing demand caused the rapid growth of housing costs and increased inequality between local housing owners and migrants. The counterfactual analysis shows that a migration-based land supply reform with regional transfers or a US-level property tax can lower within-city income inequality by 34\% and 21\%, respectively. Meanwhile, both reforms lower national income inequality by 20\%. However, only the land supply reform encourages more workers to migrate to higher productivity cities. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Thus, employing the Spatial Durbin Model, we investigate the presence of regional spillovers of skilled migration at both national and sub-national levels in China. Especially, we focus on the regional difference and change in the spatial spillover. Although our results confirm positive spillover effects at the national level due to the strong mobility characteristic of skilled migrants, developed regions benefit more from spillovers of skilled migration than developing regions, and such effects are divergent in different regions over time. Our findings also indicate that changes in spatial spillovers among regions are closely associated with the mobility of economic factors in geography. Theoretically, by considering the spatial effects of skilled migration on the innovation output of recipient regions, we extend the labour economics literature into geographical economic agglomeration, especially innovation economic geography. Methodologically, we examine the spatial effects at both national and sub-national levels, and capture the spatial externalities; we also apply Maximum Likelihood estimation to assess the endogeneity issues to understand the mechanisms of spillover change over time. The study can be of significance for municipalities in the policy-making of attracting talents and promoting regional innovation.},

First, we document that the historical presence of European immigrants is associated with a more liberal political ideology and with stronger preferences for redistribution among US born individuals today. Next, we show that this correlation is not driven by the characteristics of the counties where immigrants settled or other specific, socioeconomic immigrants' traits. Finally, we conjecture and provide evidence that immigrants brought with them their preferences for the welfare state from their countries of origin. Consistent with the hypothesis that immigration left its footprint on American ideology via cultural transmission from immigrants to natives, we show that our results are stronger when inter-group contact between natives and immigrants, measured with either intermarriage or residential integration, was higher. Our findings also indicate that immigrants influenced American political ideology during one of the largest episodes of redistribution in US history --- the New Deal -- and that such effects persisted after the initial shock.},

However, few studies have investigated the effects of large-scale and various types of internal migrants on innovation in developing countries.

Using the predicted share of migrants as an instrumental variable for migration, this study examines the causal effects and mechanisms of internal migration on innovation in China from 2000 to 2015. Our results indicate that internal migration significantly promotes innovation in China. The promotion effects of migration are more pronounced among high-skilled, `urban hukou,' and urban-urban migrants as well as in coastal areas, larger cities, and cities with higher levels of public services. Migrants can broaden the local human capital stock, enhance cultural diversity, and improve skill complementarity in their destination areas, thereby facilitating innovation. This study highlights the contribution of various types of internal migrants to innovation in China, which differs significantly from previous studies on international migrants in developed countries. These findings provide new insight into migration and innovation and offer references for other developing countries to formulate sustainable migration and innovation policies.},

Our estimation results show that college education significantly increases graduates' likelihood of working in the city where their college is located. However, a model that does not consider the self-selection effect overestimates this impact. The impact of college location on a graduate's migration decision varies considerably across cities. There is significant heterogeneity between students from universities of different tiers and rural versus urban areas. Meanwhile, the graduates show a marked home preference when choosing their job locations, and they tend to avoid working in cities with high housing costs.

This paper studies the role of the hukou system --- a household registration system in mainland China that categorizes individuals into rural and urban groups --- in shaping marital sorting patterns. Specifically, I evaluate a policy that granted men the same rights to transfer their hukou status to children as women. The policy significantly increased hukou intermarriages, particularly between rural women and urban men. By estimating a two-sided directed search and matching model, I find that the policy distorted the marriage market by increasing search frictions to a greater extent for rural men than for urban men. Highly educated rural men would have benefited the most if this policy had not been implemented, indicating that they suffered the most welfare loss, at least in terms of marriage outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of social status in shaping marriage markets and the impact of status-related policy interventions on welfare outcomes. {\copyright} The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

To address the endogeneity of immigrants' location choices, the most commonly-used instrument interacts national inflows by country of origin with immigrants' past geographic distribution. We present evidence that estimates based on this "shift-share" instrument conflate the short- and long-run responses to immigration shocks. If the spatial distribution of immigrant inflows is stable over time, the instrument is likely to be correlated with ongoing responses to previous supply shocks. Estimates based on the conventional shift-share instrument are therefore unlikely to identify the short-run causal effect. We propose a "multiple instrumentation" procedure that isolates the spatial variation arising from changes in the country-of-origin composition at the national level and permits us to estimate separately the short- and long-run effects. Our results are a cautionary tale for a large body of empirical work, not just on immigration, that rely on shift-share instruments for causal inference.},

Second, as the technologies mature and the number of related jobs grows, hiring spreads geographically. This process is very slow, taking around 50 years to disperse fully. Third, while initial hiring in new technologies is highly skill-biased, over time the mean skill level in new positions declines, drawing in an increasing number of lower-skilled workers. Finally, the geographic spread of hiring is slowest for higher-skilled positions, with the locations where new technologies were pioneered remaining the focus for the technology's high-skill jobs for decades.},

We show that temporary migration due to the SDY program created lasting inter-province links. We interact these links with two time-varying pull measures in potential destinations. Decades after the SDY program ended, increased access to migration in cities that sent SDY leads to higher rates of migration from provinces where those SDY temporarily resided. We find that improved access to migration leads to lower consumption volatility and lower asset holding. Furthermore, household production shifts into high-risk, high-return activities.

Relying on patent data from the US Patent and Trademark Office during the period 1995-2019, we are able to identify 27118 patent citation pairs (focusing only on USPTO patents with first inventors residing in China). In order to explain the number of citations from a Province to another, in addition to geographic and technological proximity, we use factor analysis in order to capture the effect of regional research structure. In particular, we measure the private versus public research intensity of each Chinese administrative province. Our econometric results show that, as expected, geographical and technological distance between Provinces are negatively correlated with patent citations. In addition, we find that Chinese administrative provinces that show bigger intensity with regard to public and to private research both receive more patent citations and cite more other patents in other Provinces. This effect is particularly significant when the two regions are specialized in private research, which indicates a strong effect of cognitive proximity. Finally, and at odds with prior research, we find that controlling for social proximity between Provinces does not impact the effect of geographical and technological proximity. These results, if confirmed by further studies, might have significant policy implications.},

The main results are not only robust to alternative choices of city sample, HSR connection measure, citation measure, and citation windows, as well as other tests, but also remain when the endogeneity concern is addressed. And evidence has been found that academic conferences and the establishment of non-local subsidiaries serve as mechanisms through which HSR connection affects cross-regional knowledge spillovers. The heterogeneity effects of HSR connection are also in line with expectations, where cities with larger innovation capacity gaps, industries with higher delivery costs and faster technological upgrading, and patents with more technological innovation content experience greater impacts of HSR connection. These findings thus provide consistent support for the beneficial effects of transportation infrastructure upgrading on knowledge transfer and technological innovation.},

This result is robust to several sensitivity tests of the empirical specification. Heterogeneity analyses demonstrate that this positive effect is more pronounced for the new-generation and highly educated rural-to-urban migrants.

These incentives become stronger as developing countries grow in size and wealth, thus allowing them to prevent the `poaching' of their `brains' by larger, wealthier markets.},

Exploring the criteria used in the initial land allocation in the early 1980s, we argue that our finding of a negative relationship between land holding and permanent migration in terms of hukou change has a causal interpretation. We also contribute to the literature by empirically examining the impact of land holding on temporary and permanent migration decisions simultaneously. We find that land holding reduces the likelihood of permanent migration but has a smaller effect on temporary migration decisions. Using a hypothetical survey question, we find that providing full access to urban social benefits to even ``landless'' households would result in only a moderate increase in the number of rural individuals intending to settle permanently in urban areas. Our results suggest that reforms of rural land rights and urban social benefits alone may not be sufficient to attract a large proportion of rural individuals to permanently settle in urban areas. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Skilled emigration (or brain drain) from developing to developed countries is becoming the dominant pattern of international migration today. Such migration is likely to affect the world distribution of income both directly, through the mobility of people, and indirectly, as the prospect of migration affects the rate of return to education in both the sending and receiving economies. This migration pattern will therefore affect human capital accumulation and fertility decisions in both the sending and receiving economies. This paper analyzes these effects in a dynamic two country model of the world economy where agents in both countries make optimal fertility and human capital decisions. The implications of the analysis for the world distribution of income are derived in the light of recent empirical findings of the brain drain literature. The analysis shows that the current trend towards predominantly skilled emigration from poor to rich countries may in the long run increase inequality in the world distribution of income as relatively poor countries grow large in terms of population. In the short run however, it is possible for world inequality to fall due to rises in GDP per capita in large developing economies with sufficiently low skilled emigration rates.},

The first notable development is the availability of patent data on an increasingly global scale and the accompanying global spread of research using patent data. The availability of global patent data has increased the value of patent information in a number of ways. The second notable development is the significant expansion of research using citation information as well as better understanding of its nature. Citation information has been found to provide very useful information on the value of patents, although backward citation as a measure of information flow is found to be more controversial. The third major development is the extensive implementation of surveys such as the ``innovation survey'' of firms and the inventor survey. They have deepened our understanding of the usefulness and the constraints of bibliographic indicators based on patent. The forth development is better understanding of the nature of the patent system and the reformulation of patent data, a good example of which is the development of patent family data, based on priority information.},

We present the evidence that the export growth in China has significant impacts on interregional migration. Using 2005 Chinese Population Census data, we estimate the impacts of export growth on the location choices of the migrant workers across prefectures. The results imply that for a 1000 USD increase in export growth per worker in a prefecture, the probability of migrant workers choosing the prefecture increases significantly by 0.77 percentage points. The effects of export growth have heterogeneity on different education and hukou type groups of migrant workers. We show that the effects are driven by the increases in the mean wage rates and the improvements of job opportunities for migrant workers. Our estimates reveal important trade-offs for prefecture attributes related to the probability of migration. {\copyright} 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {How does inventors' migration affect international talent allocation, knowledge diffusion, and productivity growth? To answer this question, I build a novel two-country innovation-led endogenous growth model, where heterogeneous inventors produce innovations, learn from others, and make dynamic migration and return decisions. Migrants interact with individuals at origin and destination, diffusing knowledge within and across countries. To quantify this framework, I construct a micro-level data set of migrant inventors on the U.S.-EU corridor from patent data and document that (i) gross migration is asymmetric, with brain drain (net emigration) from the EU to the United States; (ii) migrants increase their patenting by 33\% a year after migration; (iii) migrants continue working with inventors at origin after moving, although less frequently; (iv) migrants' productivity gains spill over to their collaborators at origin, who increase patenting by 16\% a year when a co-inventor emigrates. I calibrate the model to match the empirical results and study the effect of innovation and migration policy. A tax cut for foreigners and return migrants in the EU that eliminates the brain drain increases EU innovation but lowers U.S. innovation and knowledge spillovers. The former effect dominates in the first 25~years, increasing EU productivity growth by 3\%, but the latter dominates in the long run, lowering growth by 3\%. On the migration policy side, doubling the size of the U.S. H1B visa program increases U.S. and EU growth by 4\% in the long run, because it sorts inventors to where they produce more innovations and knowledge spillovers.},

Our results show that different typologies of returnees (employees, technologists, and managers) with different experiences abroad (work vs study) may bring back different skills and impact differently on firm innovation. Our main findings show that (1) returnee employees and technologists are positively associated with firm's patenting; (2) returnees' overseas work experience matters more than study experience; and (3) the positive role of returnees is subject to contingencies related to firm characteristics such as ownership, location, and size.},

This study investigated how migration affected household energy poverty in rural China. Drawing on data from the China Family Panel Studies, we adopted the instrumental variable method to examine the causal relationship between internal migration and energy poverty and probe its mechanisms. We found that internal migration significantly reduced the likelihood of family energy poverty. Specifically, the probability of energy poverty in a family with labor migration was 13.1\% lower than in a family without labor migration, and the probability of energy poverty decreased by 6.4\% when each additional laborer in the family migrated. Furthermore, a heterogeneity analysis revealed that labor migration had a particularly significant impact on families in central and western regions and villages near counties. Migration also plays amore important role for low-income households with lesseducatedmale heads. The mechanism analysis revealed that labor migration could reduce the probability of family energy poverty by increasing family income, which outweighed the negative effects of the increased share of elderly and children left behind by migration. These findings offer important policy insights for countries undergoing development and transformation.},

There was a rural land system reform in rural China that provided increased compensation for rural land expropriation and allowed the transaction of collective construction land for business purposes. We determine an increase in urban settlement intentions of rural migrants following the reform as an exogenous change in rural land transfer of rural migrants. We examine two mechanisms that may explain how the reform increased the settlement intentions of rural migrants, and our empirical evidence suggests that the reform increased social integration and reduced rural place attachment of rural migrants. Furthermore, we determine variations in the effect of the reform across migrants of various ages, social security benefits, and migration distances. Overall, this study extends the implications of the market-oriented rural land reform to sustainable and inclusive urbanization and highlights the role of social integration and rural place attachment in migration decisions. {\copyright} 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract = {This paper shows how deportation policies can backfire by dis-seminating not only ideas between countries but also criminal networks, spreading gangs, in this case, across El Salvador, and spurring migration back to the United States. In 1996, the US Illegal Immigration Responsibility Act increased the number of criminal deportations. In particular, the members of large Salvadoran gangs developed in Los Angeles were sent back to El Salvador. Using varia-tion in criminal deportations over time and across cohorts, combined with geographical variation in US gangs' location, I find that these deportations led to an increase in homicide rates and gang activity,as well as an increase in gang recruitment and migration of children.

  abstract = {In this article, I jointly investigate the political and the economic effects of immigration, and study the causes of anti-immigrant sentiments. I exploit exogenous variation in European immigration to U.S. cities between 1910 and 1930 induced by World War I and the Immigration Acts of the 1920s, and instrument immigrants' location decision relying on pre-existing settlement patterns. I find that immigration triggered hostile political reactions, such as the election of more conservative legislators, higher support for anti-immigration legislation, and lower redistribution. Exploring the causes of natives' backlash, I document that immigration increased natives' employment, spurred industrial production, and did not generate losses even among natives working in highly exposed sectors. These findings suggest that opposition to immigration was unlikely to have economic roots. Instead, I provide evidence that natives' political discontent was increasing in the cultural differences between immigrants and natives. Results in this article indicate that, even when diversity is economically beneficial, it may nonetheless be socially hard to manage.},

  abstract = {China's structural changes have brought new challenges to its regional employment structures, entailing labour redistribution. Until now, Chinese migration research with a forward-looking perspective and on bilateral longitudinal determinants at the prefecture city level is almost non-existent. This paper investigates the effects of job prospects on individual migration decisions across prefecture boundaries. To this end, we created proxy variables for wage and employment prospects, introduced reference-dependence to a dynamic discrete choice model, and estimated corresponding empirical specifications with a unique quasi-panel of 66,427 individuals from 283 cities during 1997--2017. To address multilateral resistance to migration resulting from the future attractiveness, we exploited various monadic and dyadic fixed effects. Multilevel logit models and two-step system GMM estimation were adopted for the robustness check. Our primary findings are that a 10\% increase in the ratio of sector-based employment prospects in cities of destination to cities of origin raises the probability of migration by 1.281--2.185 percentage points, and the effects tend to be stronger when the scale of the ratio is larger. Having a family migration network causes an increase of approximately 6 percentage points in migratory probabilities. Further, labour migrants are more likely to be male, unmarried, younger, or more educated. Our results suggest that the ongoing industrial reform in China influences labour mobility between cities, providing important insights for regional policymakers to prevent brain drain and to attract relevant talent. {\copyright} 2022 The Author(s).

Using prefecture-level data and the China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS), and adopting a difference-in-differences model, we explore the effect of HSR connection on urban innovation as well as its mechanisms. The results indicate that compared with non-HSR cities, the innovation in connected cities significantly improves after HSR connection. The results remain robust after using an instrumental variable to deal with the possible endogeneity problem caused by the non-random placement of the HSR routes. Further investigations on the mechanisms show that one reason for the innovation improvement in HSR cities is the flow of talents from non-HSR cities to connected ones. The other reason for this increase is that HSR reinforces the interaction of talents among cities along the HSR routes.},

Based on empirical analysis conducted by using over one million records of land transaction data between 2008 and 2018 in Chinese cities, we observe that cities with a larger ratio of redevelopment land in the total area of land supply on average have attracted more of the migrant population. Moreover, a high proportion of redevelopment area for public services and infrastructure in the total land redevelopment area can further attract migrants. We also find a larger effect of land redevelopment in attracting migrant inflows in less developed regions than developed regions. These findings suggest the advantages of intensive urban strategy (`compact urban') compared with extensive urban strategy (`urban sprawl') in attracting migrant population. Implications of these findings for urban governancear are discussed. {\copyright} 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

I study the first modern global banking crisis originating in London in 1866 and collect archival loan records that link multinational banks headquartered there to their lending abroad. Countries exposed to bank failures in London immediately exported significantly less and did not recover their lost growth relative to unexposed places. Their market shares within each destination also remained significantly lower for four decades. Decomposing the persistent market-share losses shows that they primarily stem from lack of extensive-margin growth, as the financing shock caused importers to source more from new trade partnerships. Exporters producing more substitutable goods, those with little access to alternative forms of credit, and those trading with more distant partners experienced more persistent losses, consistent with the existence of sunk costs and the importance of finance for intermediating trade.},

  abstract = {China's Hukou system, established in 1958, institutionalized social welfare disparities. This study examined the impact of China's Hukou reform---an institutional change initiated in 2014 that aimed to gradually expand the coverage of basic social benefits from the local Hukou population to the entire resident population---on the education expenditures of migrant households and the human capital development of migrant children using panel data from the China Family Panel Survey from 2012 to 2018. Drawing on regional variations in the pace of the reform, we applied the difference-in-differences method, and found that the reform significantly increased the investment in education for migrant households, with the increase mainly arising from in-school expenditures (with the exception of sponsorship fees) rather than from off-school expenditures. The analysis of the underlying mechanism shows that, first, although the reform has expanded the access to public education for migrant children, the local governments did not invest more in public education following the reform (substitution effects). Second, the Hukou reform appears to have eliminated resource discrimination and improved quality within the public education system, which increases migrant families' expectations for their children's education; this also prompts them to increase their in-school education expenditures to improve the quality of their children's education (flypaper effects). Finally, increases in migrant family income also play a role (income effects). Our study has strong practical implications for policymakers, who need to sustain the supply of human capital for economic development by providing education to migrant children, while moderating the effects of social welfare reforms to reduce possible governance risks. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

The prevalent view of China's hukou reform emphasizes its attraction for low-skilled workers, neglecting its considerable impact on high-skilled individuals. We find that the hukou reform cities attracted more high-skilled migrants. The greater availability of high-skilled migrants due to the hukou reform did not significantly affect the overall employment and income of urban natives. However, the reform did lead to employment shifts among urban natives, and these effects were most pronounced among high-skilled and medium-skilled urban natives. In addition, we find evidence that the reform attracted more self-employed individuals and private-owned enterprises (POEs), which stimulated local labor demand, especially for high-skilled workers.},
